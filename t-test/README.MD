### P-value

- **low p-value** can give statistical evidence to **support rejecting the null hypothesis** (however, does not prove the alt hyp is true)
- if alpha is 0.05, then 5% change of incorrectly rejecting the null hypothesis
- Shapiro-Wilk (normality test) - null hypothesis is that the population is normally distributed

### Paired Samples T-Test Example

In the analysis below:

 - the null hypothesis (moon vs other behavoir is the same) - **p < 0.001** so we reject the null hypothesis
 - the Shapiro-Wilk null hypothesis is that the data is normally distributed - **p = 0.148** so we do not reject the null hypothesis
